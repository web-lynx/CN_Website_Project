    <h1>Fun Brain Facts</h1>
    <p>The human brain is a really fascinating thing, and how we conceive of consciousness and perceive ourselves and our surroundings is one of the most interesting fields, both philosophically and anatomically. Those two aren't mutually exclusive, either!</p>
    <p>I thought I'd include some Fun Brain Facts, including a little blurb about my final project at university, as well as some tidbits that might be handy for anyone who's currently learning things (which is everyone).</p>

        <h2>False Memories and False Testimony</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." (Exodus 20:16)</p>
        <p>When we think about the world of law, whether it's the fictional environment of an Ace Attorney game, or a real representation of a courtroom by a talented sketch artist at Kirkcaldy Crown Court, we think of a jury, and witnesses. Forensic evidence doesn't get nearly as much of a look-in - to the enormous cost of our justice system in real terms. Juries are overwhelmingly influenced by witness testimony.</p>
        <p>The problem is that eyewitness testimony can be incorrect and misleading.</p>
        <p>'The Role of Eyewitness Statements in Memory Conformity' was the title of my project (if you want to see my data, check out <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134739">this link</a>) and while the title is absurdly wordy, the premise is very simple - it is surprisingly easy to influence someone with entirely incorrect data.</p></div>
        <div class="item-wide">
            <h3>Experimental Design</h3>
            <p>Our experiment was very simple - you'd come in for two sessions. In the first session, I'd ask you to watch a short video of a crime being committed. A man would come into a pub, trying to sell a stolen video camera to people. Eventually, he'd sit down at a table and offer it to three different people - a man, a woman with short hair, and a woman with long hair. After some negotiation, the short-haired woman purchases the stolen camera - fade to black.</p>
            <p>Then we made you watch five minutes of Countryfile, because it stops you repeating things inside your head (which would be cheating).</p>
            <p>After that, we gave people one of three potential eyewitness statements - either the correct details (it was the short-haired woman), incorrect details (it was the long-haired woman) or simply a neutral testimony which blamed no-one. </p>
            <p>All three of these statements were identical, but we'd also give you a little background on your friendly eyewitness - namely that they'd either be a young woman (21) or an older woman (82).</p>
            <p>You might imagine that the false testimony would be more influential in the second week, but a lot of eyewitness testimony is already conflicting at the scene. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item-wide">
            <h3>Results!</h3>
            <p>So, a week later, you come in, sit down, and answer a battery of questions. One of those is the most important - who bought the stolen camera?</p>
            <p>Generally, people did a fair job at getting it right in five of the six categories - they'd blame the right person around 75% of the time. But those participants who were given the incorrect statement by the young eyewitness blamed the wrong woman <b>40% of the time!</b></p>

    <h2>Focused vs. Diffuse Learning</h2>
    <div class="container-alt">
        <div class="item">
            <p>On a really quick, information-dense course like this, it can be challenging to learn topics and keep up with the pace - even for someone with plenty of experience. Sometimes we can feel like we "can't learn" as easily as others, but you can actually <em>learn how to learn</em>.</p>
            <p>Sounds weird? Well, the human brain is actually pretty consistent on how we process information, create new memories, and recall them later. Our patterns of thought can be generally divided into two modes - the Focused Mode, and the Diffuse Mode.</p>
            <p>When we're in the focused mode, we're able to nail down into patterns we've already established. That means that if we have a framework to work within, we can do some genuinely deep work and methodically approach something.</p>
            <p>In contrast, when we're in the diffuse mode, we're able to make newer connections more easily, in a free-form manner. Ironically, it's therefore easier to make new connections and integrate new knowledge by actually taking a break from studying entirely. "Sleeping" on a problem you've been having isn't just folk wisdom - it's a scientifically proven method!</p>
