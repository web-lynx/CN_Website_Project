    <h2>Hi, my name is Alexander R. Wayland!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to a very simple overview of some of my hobbies, interests, and influences. I thought this would be a fun way for me to introduce me to others, and experiment a little with representing information in different ways both using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>Also, I couldn't really think of a solid three-page idea that didn't use JavaScript except an especially niche one that I thought might end up using too many copyrighted images.</p>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <a class="quote" href="books.html"><img class="preview" src="images/library.png" alt="A photograph of the library within London's Victoria Gallery & Museum."></a>
        <p>A lot of people will say that books are hugely influential to them, and I definitely agree. I grew up with a less-than-formal education from thirteen to eighteen, so reading was a huge part of my development</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <h2>The Brain</h2>
        <a class="quote" href="brain.html"><img class="preview" src="images/modelbrain.png" alt="A photograph of a model of the brain. It has been cut in half sagittally, across the corpus callosum."></a>
        <p>Psychology has been a long-held interest of mine even before I did my Bachelors of Science in it. I try to continue to learn about the brain and Psychology, even when it's tucked away in other disciplines.

    <div class="item">
        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <a class="quote" href="coffee.html"><img class="preview" src="images/coffee.png" alt=""></a>
        <p>Maybe this is a programmer stereotype, but I've been a caffeine and coffee evangelist for most of my life now, and I absolutely love it. If you love coffee and want to share it with me, or if you hate it and maybe don't mind some suggestions, check it out!</p>
