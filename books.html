    <div class="content">
        <p>Everyone reads (you're reading this right now), so books are a very universal experience. Although, given that the most popular subgenre of books is probably footballer autobiographies, this might not be quite as universal of a list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    <h2>Fiction</h2>
    <div class="item">
        <h3>Cosmere Series</h3>
        <p><i>Brandon Sanderson</i></p>
        <p>This really is an enormous body of work, with 12 full-length novels, 10 short works from short stories to novellas, and even 3 graphic novels. Hell, there's a roleplaying game (albeit not entirely canon)</p>
        <p>Brandon's characters are a cut above most authors', with genuine flaws, their own distinct voices, and amazing character development and arcs. While this series is enormous and stretches from 2005 until 2020 so far, it's absolutely worth investing the time. </p>
        <p>Start with The Final Empire, the first Mistborn book - and find yourself fascinated by conscientiously-considered magical systems, stylish thieves, and the excellent premise of "what if the bad guy won?"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <h3>Perdido Street Station</h3>
        <p><i>China Mieville</i></p>
        <p>The forerunner of "the new weird", a genre of surreal and bizarre fantasy that exceeds all the previous strangeness of the genre, Perdido Street Station is a brutal, depressing, violent exploration of an oddly-realistic unreal setting. Characters struggle with the same issues we do, just through the lens of strange magic, human-animal hybrids, and terrifying extradimensional spiders.</p>
        <p>I promise, despite how brutal it is, it's worth reading.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <h3>Rivers of London</h3>
        <p><i>Ben Aaronovitch</i></p>
        <p>Sort of a less-pulpy British answer to the Dresden Files, this book (and its' following novels) delve into fictionalised British mythology, from the river-goddesses of London themselves, to Punch and Judy, and Nazi wizards.</p>
        <p>These are an easy read, but an overwhelmingly satisfying one, with an everyman protagonist who explores the setting as we do.</p>
    </div>

</div>

    <div class="container-alt">
        <h2>Non-Fiction</h3>
        <div class="item">
        <h3>On Writing</h3>
            <p><i>Stephen King</i></p>
            <p>Probably a fairly obvious choice for most people wanting to explore creative writing, but legitimately the best overall toolkit for the beginner, with an interesting exploration of King's own life and career as well, including his battle with addiction.</p>
            <p><i>"Tabby asked me if I drank the Listerine. I responded ... I most certainly did not. Nor did I. I drank the Scope instead. It was tastier, had that hint of mint."</i></p>
            <p>If you want to write some of your own books, this is an excellent place to start - just don't follow all his advice about endings!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <h3>The Bullet Journal Method</h3>
            <p><i>Ryder Carroll</i></p>
            <p>Might be a bit odd for a digitally-oriented person to recommend taking notes on paper, but Ryder Carroll's free method is explained in glorious detail in this book, showing the philosophical and psychological underpinning of a notetaking system that is tremendously elegant.</p>
            <p>Ryder himself developed the system to help with his ADHD, and uses it both to maintain focus on his tasks, and a clear path for his life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
            <p><i>James Clear</i></p>
            <p>There's an enormous amount of productivity and self-help books out there, but the overwhelming majority are just repackaged folk wisdom or super-specific advice that's purely personal to the author.</p>
            <p>James Clear bucks this stereotype entirely - Atomic Habits is a great book not only for understanding how we build habits and good behaviours in the first place, but also how to hack them together in your life, daisy-chaining your way towards a happier and healthier life.</p>
